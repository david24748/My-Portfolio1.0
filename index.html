            <h2>Colombia Chamber</h2>
            <p>At the heart of my first project is a dynamic website that aims to attract international tourists to Colombia. 
              The site will be a one-stop resource, providing essential information on where to stay, what to see, and how to experience Colombia in ways that align with any budget. <a href="Chamber/index.html"> Click here to see the project</a></p>

            <h2>Interactive List Creation</h2>
            <p>In today's digital landscape, effective data management is key. In this project, I developed 
              an intuitive interface using Visual Studio, enabling users to effortlessly add and remove items 
              on a webpage. This versatile component can be seamlessly integrated into any website, whether
               serving as a shopping cart, a wish list, or simply a space for quick notes. <a href="DOM-manipulation/bom.html"> Click here to see the project</a></p>

            <h2>Progressive Loading of Images</h2>
            <p>Optimizing the loading speed of website images is crucial for a seamless user experience. 
              In this project, I implemented a progressive loading strategy for five images, each configured 
              with specific parameters. This approach ensures that as users access the page, they are presented
               with fully rendered visuals instead of blank placeholders—enhancing both the perceived performance 
               and overall impression of the site. <a href="lesson 7/lazyload.html"> Click here to see the project</a></p>

            <p>Data tables serve as an effective means of presenting organized information, enabling users 
              to easily visualize how data structures or budgetary allocations vary based on specific parameters. 
              In this project, I developed an interactive data table using Visual Studio, HTML, and CSS, 
              empowering users to explore the information and draw their own conclusions. <a href="lesson 8/tablebuild.html"> Click here to see the project</a></p>

            <p>APIs are essential tools in modern web development, providing users with dynamic, real-time 
              data that enhances their online experience. In this project, I integrated a third-party API 
              to deliver current weather information. The data is presented through a streamlined information 
              box, allowing users to quickly access and benefit from up-to-date weather updates. <a href="APIweather/weather-api.html"> Click here to see the project</a></p>

            <h2>Temple Chamber Project</h2>
            <p>The Temple Chamber Project is designed to promote a hotel chain located near the temples of the Church 
              of the Saints of the Last Days. The website features several interactive elements, enabling users to 
              submit their contact information directly to the hotel representatives and explore the diverse services 
              offered by the chain. With a strong focus on user engagement and a commitment to maintaining sound design 
              principles, I incorporated a voting section that allows visitors to “like” the temple that resonates with 
              them the most. This interactive component not only personalizes the experience but also enhances overall user engagement. <a href="Hotel-project///index.html"> Click here to see the project</a></p>

                  <p>Anecdotes from students 
                    recounting their mysterious experiences within the halls of a centuries-old institution. 
                    we delve into the paranormal tales that have shaped one of Colombia’s most iconic universities. By employing diverse 
                    camera angles, we aim to evoke an atmosphere rich in raw intensity and solitude. 
                    In one segment, Santiago—who juggles both his studies and work in education—shares his

                  <p>Cats are known for their self-centered nature, often claiming even the simplest 
                    objects—like a humble box—as their own. In this short film, we capture the quirky 
                    and sometimes challenging experience of living with more than one feline companion.</p>

                      to design a series of poker cards with a Viking-era-inspired style. The primary goal was to capture the player's 
                      attention and appeal to a specific audience interested in collecting unique cards. I invested a 
                      significant amount of time, particularly during the finalization stage, to ensure the printed results 
                      matched the intended design. The goal was successfully achieved, and the cards were donated to an educational institution.">

                      Gorillaz to conceive and develop a graphic illustration that embodied a vibrant, modern style. Using Photoshop as the main tool, 
                      we carefully focused on visual details, textures, and colors to evoke a sensation that could seamlessly fit into the cover of a 
                      music album. The design aimed not only to capture the dynamic and experimental spirit associated with Gorillaz but also to convey a 
                      unique energy that would resonate with a contemporary audience. This project was created as an opportunity to apply and showcase 
                      the skills gained through various graphic and digital design courses. Every aspect of the process, from conceptualization to final 
                      execution, reflected a commitment to continuous learning and creativity. The final result not only achieved its aesthetic goal but

                      specific culture, with the aim of respectfully paying homage to its values and beliefs. I created a detailed illustration of Vishnu that 
                      incorporates a stained-glass effect, designed to capture the audience's attention and highlight the symbolic beauty of this representation. 
                      This approach aimed to produce a unique visual impact, evoking a sense of reverence and cultural connection. The creation of this 
                      piece required a careful selection of colors, shapes, and textures to replicate the aesthetics of stained glass and convey a message 
                      of respect toward the represented culture. This project focused not only on technical precision but also on fostering a deeper appreciation

                      confrontation. Lastly, darkness was portrayed using shadows, deep contrasts, and a dark color palette, adding drama to the composition.

                      offering the viewer a perspective that goes beyond a flat design. Using specific visual techniques, the aim was to give the text a three-dimensional effect 
                      that captures the audience's attention and provides a more immersive experience. The design focused on the strategic placement of shadows, gradients, 
                      and contrasts to create a perspective effect, transforming a conventional element into something visually appealing and dynamic. This project not only 
                      explores how small adjustments can create a significant visual impact but also highlights the importance of merging creativity and technique to communicate concepts effectively.">
